          This dashboard provides an overview of your Ecobee's performance based on the learning integration.
          'AC Runtime' shows the current runtime, while 'Average Runtime' shows the historical average.
          'Avg. Time per 1°F Change' indicates how long it typically takes to change the temperature by one degree.
          The 'Energy Efficiency Score' provides a measure of how efficiently your system is operating.
          'Estimated Daily Cost' gives you an idea of your HVAC energy expenses.
          An alert is triggered when the current runtime significantly exceeds the average runtime.
          The outdoor temperature is also displayed to help understand how external conditions affect your system's performance.
